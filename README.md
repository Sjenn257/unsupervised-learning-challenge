## Cryptocurrency Clusters

In this challenge, I used unsupervised learning to classify a dataset of cryptocoins that were in the trading market. Our client is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. My job was to determine if they can be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
